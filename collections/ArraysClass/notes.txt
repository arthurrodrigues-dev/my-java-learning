Arrays Class

-> Arrays class is an utility class that defines several utility methods for Array objects.

SORTING ELEMENTS OF ARRAY 

1. public static void sort(primitive[] p);
-> Sort a primitive array according to DNSO.

2. public static void sort(Object[] o);
-> Sort an object array according to DNSO.

3. public static void sort(Object[] o, Comparator c);
-> Sort an object array according to customized sorting order.

Note:

Primitive array can be sorted only with DNSO.
Object array can be sorted with both DNSO or CSO.

SEARCHING ELEMENTS OF ARRAY

-> Arrays class defines the following binary search methods:

1. public static int binarySearch(primitive[] p, primitive target);

2. public static int binarySearch(Object[] a, Object target);

3. public static int binarySearch(Object[] a, Object target, Comparator c);

Note:

All rules of arrays class binary search methods are exactly same as Collections class binary search methods.

CONVERSION OF ARRAY TO LIST AND LIST TO ARRAY

1. public static List asList(Object[] a);
-> This method won't create an independent list object. For the existing array, we are getting list "view".

Example:
String[] s = {"A", "Z", "B"};
List l = Arrays.asList(s);

String[] s -------> ["A", "Z", "B"]
                        ^
                        |
List l ------------------


-> Changes made in any one, array or list will be reflected because both are pointing to the same object.
-> By using list reference, we can't perform any operation which vary the size, otherwise we'll get RuntimeException saying UnsupportedOperationException.
-> By using list reference, we are not allowed to replace with Heterogeneous objects (but you can with homogeneous objects). Otherwise, we will get RuntimeException saying ArrayStoreException.
