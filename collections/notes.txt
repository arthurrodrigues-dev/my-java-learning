What is collection?
-> If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity then we should go for collection.

What is Collection Framework?
-> It defines several classes and interfaces which can be used a group of objects as a single entity.

Parallel between Java and C++:

JAVA                    |               C++
1. Collection;          | 1. Container;
2. Collection framwork. | 2. STL (Standard Template Library).

9 Keys interfaces of Collection Framework:

1. Collection:
-> Collection interface defines the most common methods which are applicable for any Collection object.
-> In general, collection interface is considered as root interface of Collection Framework.
NOTE: There is no concrete class which implements collection interface directly.
-> Collection vs Collections:
* Collection is a interface!
* Collections is an utility class present in java.util.package to define several utility methods (like sorting, searching...) for Collection objects
