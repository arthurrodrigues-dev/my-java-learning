HashMap

-> Underlying DS for HashMap is HashTable
-> Insertion order not preserved, it is based on hashCode only of keys.
-> Duplicate keys is not allowed, but duplicate values is allowed.
-> Heterogeneous keys and values are allowed.
-> Null is allowed for key, but only once and allowed for values (any number of times).
-> Implements Cloneable and Serializable
-> HashMap is the best choice when frequent operation is Search.

HashMap constructors:

1. HashMap m = new HashMap();
-> Creates an empty HashMap with initial capacity 16 and default fill ratio 0.75.

2. HashMap m = new HashMap(int initialCapacity);
-> Creates a HashMap with given initial capacity.

3. HashMap m = new HashMap(int initialCapacity, float fillRatio);
-> Creates a HashMap with given initial capacity and fill ratio.

4. HashMap m = new HashMap(Map m);
-> Creates an equivalent HashMap from a given Map.
