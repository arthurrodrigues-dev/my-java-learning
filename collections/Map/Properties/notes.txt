Properties

-> In our program, if anything changes frequently (like username, password,
mail-ids, mobile number, etc) are not recommended to hard code (keep the values
in the source code) in java program because if there is any change, to reflect 
that change recompilation, rebuild, redeploy are required and even sometimes server restart is also required which creates a big business impact to the client.

-> We can overcome this problem by using properties file such type of variable
things we have to configure in the properties file. From the properties file we
have to read into java program and we can use those properties.

-> The main advantage of this approach is if there is a change in properties file
to reflect that change, just redeployment is enough which won't create any 
business impact to the client.

-> We can use java properties object to hold properties which are coming from 
properties file.

-> In normal map (like HashMap, Hashtable, TreeMap) key and value can be any type
but in the case of Properties, key and value should be String.

Properties Specific Methods:

String getProperty(String propName);
-> To get value associated with the specified property.

String setProperty(String propName, String propValue); 
-> To set a new Property, if the key already there, returns old value. 

Enumeration propertyNames();

void load(InputStream is);
-> To load properties from properties file into java properties object.

void store(OutputStream os, String comment);
-> To store properties from java properties object into properties file.
