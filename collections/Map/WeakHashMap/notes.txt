WeakHashMap

-> It is exactly same as HashMap, with one small difference:
- In the Hashmap, even if a object loses it's reference, garbage collector
can't destroy it because HashMap is "stronger" than it.
- Otherwise, WeakHashMap is "Weak" which means that garbage collector is able 
to destroy the object.
