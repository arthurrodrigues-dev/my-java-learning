LinkedHashMap

-> It is child class of HashMap
-> It is exactly same as HashMap (including methods and constructors) with two differences:
1. Underlying data structure for LinkedHashMap is Hashtable + LinkedList (Hybrid data structure)
2. Insertion order preserved.

-> Commonly used for cache based applications.
