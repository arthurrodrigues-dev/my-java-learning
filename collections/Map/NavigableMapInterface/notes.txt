-> It is child interface of SortedMap and it defines several methods for navigation purposes.

-> NavigableMap defines the following methods:

floorKey(e);
lowerKey(e);
ceilingKey(e);
higherKey(e);
pollFirstEntry(); // remove and returns first entry.
pollLastEntry(); // remove and returns last entry.
descendingMap();

This methods above has the same behavior as NavigableSet specific methods but with keys and entries.
