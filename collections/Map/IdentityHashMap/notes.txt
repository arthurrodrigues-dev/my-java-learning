Difference between the == and equals():

-> In general, double equal operator (==) is meant for reference comparison or address comparison.
-> equals is meant for values comparison

IdentityHashMap
-> It is exactly same as HashMap with one difference:
- In the case of HashMap, jvm will use equals() method to identify duplicate keys.
- In the IdentityHashMap, jvm will use double equal operator (==) to identify duplicate keys.
