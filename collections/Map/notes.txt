Introduction to Map

-> Map is NOT child interface of Collection, bc collection are used to represent single objects.
-> If we want to represent a group of objects as key-value pairs we should go for Map.
-> Duplicate keys are not allowed, but values are.
-> Each key-value is called as Entry and a map is a group of Entrys.
-> Both keys and values are objects only.
-> Map is a collection of Entry objects.
-> Map contains it's own specific methods so collection methods we can't use for map
because concepts are different.

Specific Methods:

Object put(Object key, Object value); 
-> If we try to insert a new Entry but the key is already in the map,
the value will be replaced and old value will be returned. Otherwise, null is returned.

m.putAll(Map m);
-> Put all the entries from a map to another.
