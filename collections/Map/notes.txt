Introduction to Map

-> Map is NOT child interface of Collection, bc collection are used to represent single objects.
-> If we want to represent a group of objects as key-value pairs we should go for Map.
-> Duplicate keys are not allowed, but values are.
-> Each key-value is called as Entry and a map is a group of Entrys.
-> Both keys and values are objects only.
-> Map is a collection of Entry objects.
