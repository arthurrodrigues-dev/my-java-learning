TreeSet

-> Underlying DS for TreeSet is Balanced Tree.
-> Duplicate objects are not allowed.
-> Insertion order not preserved, but all objects will be inserted acorrding to some sorting order.
-> Heterogeneous objects are not allowed.
-> Null insertion not allowed.
-> If we are depending on default natural sorting order, then objets should be homogeneous and comparable. Otherwise we will get runtime exception saying ClassCastException.
-> An object is said to be Comparable if and only if the corresponding class implements java.lang.comparable interface.

TreeSet Constructors

1. TreeSet t = new TreeSet();
-> Creates an empty TreeSet object where elements will be inserted according to default natural sorting order.

2. TreeSet t = new TreeSet(Comparator c);
-> Creates an empty TreeSet object where elements will be inserted according to customized sorting order.

TreeSet t = new TreeSet(SortedSet s);
TreeSet t = new TreeSet(Collection c);
