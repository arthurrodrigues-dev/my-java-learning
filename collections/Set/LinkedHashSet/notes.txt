LinkedHashSet

-> It is child class of HashSet 
-> It is exactly same as HashSet except for this following differences:
- The underlying DS for LinkedHashSet is HashTable + LinkedList (Hybrid DS)
- Insertion order preserved

-> LinkedHashSet is the best choice to develop cache based applications, where duplicates are not allowed and insertion order must be preserved.

LinkedHashSet has the same constructors as HashSet.
