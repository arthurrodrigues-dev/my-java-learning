HashSet

-> The underlying DS is HashTable.
-> Duplicates not allowed. If we are trying to insert duplicates, we won't get any compiletime or runtime error, add() method simply returns false.
-> Insertion order not preserved and all objects will be inserted based on hashCode of objects.
-> Heterogeneous objects are allowed.
-> Null insertion possible.
-> Implements Serializable and Clonable interfaces.
-> HashSet is the best choice, if our frequent operation is Search.

HashSet Constructors:

HashSet h = new HashSet();
-> Creates an empty HashSet with default initial capacity 16 and default fill ratio 0.75.

HashSet h = new HashSet(int initialCapacity);
HashSet h = new HashSet(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor)
HashSet h = new HashSet(Collection c);

Load Factor / Fill Ratio:
-> After loading the how much factor, a new HashSet object will be created, that factor is called as Load Factor or Fill Ratio.
