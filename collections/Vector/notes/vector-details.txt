Vector

-> Vector has all of the properties that ArrayList have, but with one difference
-> Most of the methods present in Vector are synchronized. Hence Vector is thread-safe, different of ArrayList
that is not thread-safe.

Vector Specific methods

addElement(Object o)
removeElement(Object o)
RemoveElementAt(int index)
removeAllElements()
Object elementAt(int index)
Object firstElement()
Object lastElement()

int size()
int capacity()
Enumeration elements()

Vector class Constructors:

1. Vector v = new Vector();
-> Creates an empty vector object with default initial capacity 10, once vector reaches it's max capacity, a new vector Object will be created with new capacity = 2 * current capacity.

2. Vector v = new Vector(int initialCapacity);
-> Creates an empty vector with specified initial capacity.

3. Vector v = new Vector(int initialCapacity, int incrementalCapacity);
-> Creates an empty vector with specified initial capacity and specify the incremental capacity that the vector will be increased when the capacity is full.

4. Vector v = new Vector(Collection c);
-> Creates an equivalent Vector object for the given Collection
